First of all me and my coworker needed to create a github account. 

To create github account you need to go to site [github.com](url) and hit the sign up button

Then just follow instructions on the site. 

Secondary, to create new repository you have to go to your profile and choose “Repository” tab and then click “new”.

My teammate created case_1.md file where he answered questions from the task. 

By the way to add collaborator to your project you just go to the settings tab of you repository click “collaborators” and add people.
