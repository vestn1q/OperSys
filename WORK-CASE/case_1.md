## Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to program code and store them in a repository. Git is used to keep a history of changes, collaborate on projects from multiple devices, and ensure data security.

## Basic actions and commands in Git:

Initialize the repository - `git init`

>This command initializes a new repository in the current directory. After that, a .git folder will be created in the directory where all the data about the repository will be stored.

Adding files to the repository - `git add`
>This command adds changed or new files to the index so that they can be committed later.

Commit changes - `git commit`

>This command creates a new commit with the changes that were added to the index using git add. In the commit, you can add a description of the changes to make it easier to understand what has changed.

Check the status of the repository - `git status`

>This command displays information about the status of the repository, indicating which files have been changed, which files are ready for a commit, and which files have not been added to the index.

Commit history information - `git log`

>This command displays a list of commits in the repository with descriptions of the changes that have been made.

Switching between branches - `git checkout`

>This command allows you to switch from one branch to another in order to continue working with another branch.

Merge branches - `git merge`

>This command allows you to merge changes from one branch to another.
